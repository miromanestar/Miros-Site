        Hello, my name is Miro Manestar, a student at Southern Adventist University currently working towards my Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Science!
        Ever since I was little, I was fascinated by programming. I wanted to know how computers worked, how they did the incredible tasks they seemed able to accomplish
        at incredible speeds. Most importantly, I wanted to know how to write the instructions required to "teach" computers how to do these complex tasks.

    My first introduction to "real" programming was when I was 10 through the online game "Roblox" , which allowed its users to create worlds and create scripts, 
    ranging from the exceedingly simple to the incredibly complex. Scripting was done via a modified version of lua. At the time, I had zero knowledge of programming basics 
    or concepts, and yet I would spend hours scrolling through hundreds or even thousands of lines of code attempting to understand, improve, and modify it for my own purposes.
    Later on, I would have my first formal introduction of programming concepts via Scratch, though its limitations would eventually drive me to move onward.

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    It wasn't until my sophomore year of high school where I finally had the opportunity to formally learn the basic concepts of programming. I signed up for Computer Science A,
    and proceeded to learn the basics of Java. It was quite confusing at first - but after a while and a lot of practice those concepts which had eluded me for so long began to
    make sense. Old memories of confusion at the syntax presented by Lua were finally understood, and suddenly I became conscious of the extreme depth and possibilites
    offered by programming.

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    In December of my sophomore year of high school, I decided to try and make something useful... something with more utility than a simple rock-paper-scissors-(lizard-Spock)
    program written in Java via BlueJ. My father works as a radiation dosimetrist, and at times is required to be on call. During these times, he must carry with him a large
    binder full of formulas and tables, which allowed him to perform parts of his job away from the office at a moment's notice. When he finally would get a call, a simple
    calculation might take him 15 minutes to do as he parsed through pages of data and entered them into his calculator.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Thus, the idea for RayCalc was born. A simple app which would do the calculations for him. Since he used an iPhone, I decided to make an iOS app. From there, I installed
    XCode and began learning and experimenting with Swift. By mid-February, the app was largely feature complete. It was quick, accurate, and simple, although ugly. This was
    the first version of RayCalc, which was exclusive to iOS, the source of which can be viewed on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/miromanestar/DosimetryCalculator">here</a>.
    Later on, I would go onward to create a second, much prettier version which I will get to soon.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    During all this time, I took over maintenance of Chestatee Seventh-day Adventist Church's website, located <a href="https://chestateesda.org">here</a>. At the time,
    it ran on WordPress. For several years I spent a LOT of time tinkering with and learning the basics of HTML and CSS, with a pinch of toying with JavaScript and PHP.
    Eventually, when we finally switched off of Wordpress to a more in-house solution, I used my knowledge to modify the new site to a current state, including creating
    a Youtube Gallery program with JS  and jQuery, viewable on my projects page. It loads the data via the Youtube API
    as efficiently as possible, only making a call once per day per user (Unless they hit refresh), and otherwise loads from a cache saved in localStorage.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Ever since finishing my original version of RayCalc, I had been looking at developing it for Android as well. The problem was, I absolutely despised Android Studio and
    wasn't too comfortable spending so much time remaking something for an app that was really only a proof-of-concept. Eventually, I switched my attention from a per-platform
    development standard and decided instead to see if there were options for multi-platform app development. I tried AppFlow from Adobe, but didn't like how counter-intuitive
    it was and how cryptic the documentation was (At the time, anyway). Instead, I stumbled upon Ionic, a cross-platform framework which could utilize Angular, React, or Vue 
    and combined it with plugins from Cordova (And now Capacitor) to provide native functionality on both iOS and Android.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    So, I set to work on the next version of RayCalc using Ionic with Angular. Development only took two weeks, and in that time it was greatly improved both functionally and
    visually (Including something dearly important to me, Dark Mode). This new version of RayCalc could be deployed to iOS, Android, and basically anything that could run a browser
    as Ionic essentially created a self-contained "web server" and ran its contents from that. From there, I realized I could also deploy RayCalc as a website via GitHub pages which
    is accessible <a href="https://raycalc.com">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    After experimenting with Angular (And a little Vue), I set out to make my own little website, one that wouldn't require loading to visit other pages. After a few days, this
    site was born, and I decided to use it as my little portfolio to showcase my projects and developments. It only uses jQuery, Bootstrap, FancyBox, and a few fontawesome icons
    for my youtube gallery project. Other than that, everything is made by hand, no generators or frameworks. 
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    As a child, I didn't realize the breadth of capability or the depth of complexity computers presented. The more I work with them, the less I realize I know. I have so much
    to learn, and I am endlessly fascinated by the things I can do with computers, with the doors that advancements in technology opens. I don't know where my interest in
    computers will take me, but I am eager to learn and discover what that might be.
