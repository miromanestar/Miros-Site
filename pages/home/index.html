    Hello! I'm Miro Manestar, an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my Bachelors of Computer Science degree at Southern Adventist University!
    At the moment, I have a focus on web development technologies, though I have developed significantly with Java and Swift, and a little with Python, C#, and C++.
