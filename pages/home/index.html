    Hello! I'm Miro Manestar, an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my Bachelors of Computer Science degree at Southern Adventist University!
    At the moment, I have a focus on web development technologies, though I have developed with Java, Swift, C#, and C++.
    </br></br>
    In fact, this site was born out of an experiment. I wanted to build, from the ground up, a single page application without using frameworks such as Angular,
    React, or Vue. Thus, the only libraries the site uses are jQuery, Bootstrap, FancyBox (Lightbox), and FontAwesome Icons. Other than that, everything is built
    by hand.
    </br></br>
    PLEASE NOTE: This site is still under construction and as such there will be incomplete content and styling as I learn more about how to
    actually create a website.
