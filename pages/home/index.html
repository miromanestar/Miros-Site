<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Hello! I'm Miro Manestar, an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my Bachelors of Computer Science degree at Southern Adventist University!
    At the moment, I have a focus on web development technologies, though I have developed significantly with Java and Swift, and a little with Python, C#, and C++.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    This is where I showcase various projects that I am currently working on or have already completed, but also where I experiment with new ideas related to web-development
    to further expand my abilities.
