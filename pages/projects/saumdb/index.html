<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    The SAU Missionary Interface is a simple website built for a large touch-screen contained in a large room. It allows users to easily see information relating
    to student missions at Southern Adventist University, including current student missionaries, SAU's presence around the globe, and opportunities currently available
    for students here.
