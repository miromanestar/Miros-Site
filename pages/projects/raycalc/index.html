<h4 class="mt-5">What is Raycalc?</h4>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">RayCalc is a lightweight, simple calculator for radiation dosimetry calculations when on call. Its purpose is not to replace professional software, but to provide a verification solution during emergency situations to aid against human error. The calculator utilizes data tables taken directly from Northside Forsyth hospital, and uses industry-standard formulas, along with some minor interpolation to obtain answers that have been tested to be with a less than 1% error margin.</p>
