<h4 class="mt-5">About the segmentation simulator?</h4>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    The segmentation simulator is a simple memory segmentation visualizer and virtual address translator made to show
    how memory segmentation actually works on a basic level. It includes the code, stack, and heap segments, and allows for complete
    configuration if their bases and bounds, growth direction, as well as the sizes of the physical and virtual addresses. Furthermore,
    the segmentation simulator includes comprehensive bounds checking to alert the user when something would cause a segmentation fault,
    or otherwise a different memory error.
