<h4 class="mt-5">What is Let Us Eat?</h4>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Let Us Eat is a blog intended to share recipes to facilitate healthy living, with a special focus on vegan recipes. 
    The blog site is built with Hugo and hosted via Netlify CMS, which allows users to edit pages and create new posts  from an easy-to-use admin interface without having to deal directly with Markdown, Html, CSS, or JS.
    Because the site is completely static, the only hosting costs is the domain name itself, making the site extremely cheap to run, especially compared to services like Squarespace.
