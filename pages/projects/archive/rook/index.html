<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    The game consists of 3-6 players, and each player must keep their hand secret. The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 
    points by capturing cards with a point value in tricks. 
    If more than 1 player attain more than 500 points in the same trick, the winning player is the one with the highest trick.

    Only certain cards have a point value. These are known as counters. 5s are worth 5 points, 10s and 14s are worth 10 points, 1s are worth 15 points, and
    the rook card is worth 20 points. Finally, the player who wins the last trick of a round gets an extra 20 points.
