<h4 class="text-muted">A relatively simple solution for a quick js-based horizontal masonry layout!</h4>

<h4 class="mt-5">What is this??</h4>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    An example of a horizontal masonry layout using jQuery! <br><br>
    This example utilizes jQuery to make things easier, but everything here can also be done quite easily in vanilla JS!
</p>

<p class="mt-3"><a href="https://miromanestar.github.io/jQuery-Horizontal-Masonry/">Live demo here!</a></p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Essentially allows CSS to find the expected height of the items in a vertical masonry layout, sets that height 
    (Plus an additional buffer to accomodate discrepancies) to the container, and applies some CSS flex rules depending on the window/screen size, 
    including the flexbox order property.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    That way, the JS is extremely lightweight and doesn't need to perform nearly as many calculations as traditional horizontal masonry layout solutions.
</p>

<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Support up to three columns. By default, it will organize the divs into 3 columns, and scale down as the screen shrinks. 
    This will need to be modified in both the CSS and JS files to accomodate additional column sizes.
