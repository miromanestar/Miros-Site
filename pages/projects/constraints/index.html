<p class="mt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
    Constraint-based programming is a paradigm by which a the values of certain variables are dependent upon the values of other variables.
    For example, a constrainted variable might be a variable which must always be twice the size of another variable, and thus would
    automatically recalculate should that variable change. To model this, I've created a simple application which allows you to create
    basic mathematical expressions and connect them in a visual to demonstrate how this style of programming might actually work.
